# Li2024-off-lattice

Supporting material for the paper *An off-lattice discrete model to characterise filamentous yeast colony morphology* (Li2024). 

In this work, we combine agent-based mathematical modelling, experiments, and statistical inference to investigate how cellular behaviour drives colony-scale patterns in filamentous yeast colonies.

This repository is organised into three directories:

1. ABC-MCMC: this is where we provide all the functions and data used to run each simulation, compute summary statistics and make inference using ABC-MCMC. 

2. Data: this directory contains both the raw data (tiff) and processed images (binary) of the three experimental conditions used in this work. 

3. Plotting: this folder includes all the necessary functon and scripts to reproduce all the figures used in the manuscript.
