% INPUT: 
%       N: run colony upto this amount of cells
%       Telong: Proportion of cells to be sated before switching on 
%               pseudohyphal cells probabilities
%       p2sProb: Probability of pseudohyphal cells transitioning to 
%               sated cells
%       s2pProb: Probability of sated cells transitioning to pseudohyphal 
%               cells
%       pc: Probability of second daughter cell being sated given current 
%               cell is pseudohyphal
%       pa: Probability of choosing a sated cell to proliferate
%       upr_area: upper bound of area within 5% of experimental area
%       lwr_area: lower bound of area within 5% of experimental area
%       exp_area: experimental colony pixel area
%
% OUTPUT:
%       I: a binary colony of the simulation
%       file_name: the file name associated to the simualtion including the
%       information related to the particular simulation
